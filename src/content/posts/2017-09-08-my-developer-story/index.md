I was chatting with a colleague the other day and the conversation turned to discussing how I came to be a developer. I gave him an abbreviated version of the story and he remarked that it was an interesting one, so I thought it might be worth sharing on my blog. It's been a bit of a roundabout path to end up where I am today, but I'm grateful for the experiences I've had along the way.

With my dad's help, I built my first website in the third or fourth grade. I don't remember much about for it except that it was on Geocities and had an entire page dedicated to Space Jam. I'm fairly certain there were some `marquee` tags involved. My parents have always encouraged me in my pursuit of technology and they deserve a great deal of credit for where I am today. I built a few other hobby sites throughout middle school and high school for school projects, my "photography," and similar things. Looking back, it seems like this is where I was destined to end up, but I didn't realize it at the time.

After graduating high school, I worked a couple of retail jobs: Selling video games and then selling phones next door. I fiddled with code a little but - mostly writing scripts for automating [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) - but most of the time I just worked and tried to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I tried going to college a few times, but never stayed for longer than a semester. There was something else calling me, but I didn't know what.

One summer day in 2007, bored out of my mind on a particularly slow day at the Sprint store, it struck me: I should join the Army. I did a little research and then went down to the recruiter's office. It was a pretty surprising decision for everyone involved - I've never been someone who you would picture heading off to join the military. Next thing I knew, I was shipping off to Fort Sill, Oklahoma to go through basic training and then train as a 13F: A forward observer, the guy with the radio who calls in artillery strikes. I did very well in training (distinguished honor graduate of my AIT - advanced individual training - class) and I thought I had found my calling.

I arrived at my duty station, Fort Carson, Colorado, in early 2008. I was both eager and nervous to go out into the "real Army." After spending time with some of the greatest individuals I've had the pleasure of knowing, I was certain I had found my calling. Unfortunately, fate had other plans: In April of that same year, I broke my hip during a training exercise. That was followed by a long period of uncertainty where I tried and failed to heal which ultimately ended with me being medically discharged in September 2009, almost exactly two years - to the day - from the day I had shipped off to Fort Sill. During the medical discharge process, my unit deployed to Afghanistan without me and I sunk into a deep depression. What followed was a little over a year where I didn't really do much of anything. I knew I needed to find work, but my entire future had just been ripped right out from underneath me.

At some point during that depressed daze, I decided I wanted to get into network security. I had no experience, but I knew I loved technology and wanted to work with it. Unfortunately, my desire and my (lack of) experience were in direct conflict with each other. I finally realized I needed to get my foot in the door _somewhere_, to do _something_ with technology, no matter what. Nine months after my discharge, I moved back to California and accepted a job at a small print shop turned web design agency named Highpoint. My position was a combination of customer service and quality assurance testing. It was not a bad place to work, but there were a lot of inefficiencies that were still in place from the print shop days. I can deal with a lot of annoyances but inefficiency frustrates me beyond belief, so I set out to automate some of these painful manual processes. I didn't have any grand plan at the time - I just wanted to make my job a little easier.

Luckily, Michael - the owner - saw something in me that I hadn't been paying attention to. After six months, he moved me from my customer service/QA position into a development position and I started working full time on our ColdFusion codebase. I soon rediscovered the enjoyment I had felt building websites all those years ago and knew that this was the path I wanted to continue down.

The rest of the story can be found on my resume and isn't particularly interesting: I worked on full stack applications in insurance for about five years before deciding I wanted to focus on frontend development. After making that decision, I found my current job at [DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com/), where I am enjoying myself very much.

I think I've found my calling (again) and I hope I'm able to continue working in software for a long time.
