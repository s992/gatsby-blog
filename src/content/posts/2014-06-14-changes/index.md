Well, this site has been sitting around unattended since my last post over a year ago. I figured it was about time to make some changes, so I took the opportunity to look into [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and here I am. I transferred a couple of posts over and plan to move some more this weekend. Unfortunately, I'm going to lose all of the comments from my previous blog due to changing the commenting platform to Disqus.

I'm hoping that a new platform will encourage me to start posting more often, so stay tuned!
